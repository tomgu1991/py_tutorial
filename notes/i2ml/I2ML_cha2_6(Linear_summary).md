# Chapter2_6: Linear Summary

The main parameter of linear models is the regularization parameter, called alpha in the regression models and C in LinearSVC and LogisticRegression. Large values for alpha or small values for C mean simple models.

| Purpose        | param | Change  | Effect       |
| -------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| Regression     | alpha | larger  | simple model |
| Classification | C     | smaller | simple model |

The other decision you have to make is whether you want to use L1 regularization or L2 regularization. If you assume that only a few of your features are actually important, you should use L1. Otherwise, you should default to L2.

L1 can also be useful if interpretability of the model is important. As L1 will use only a few features, it is easier to explain which features are important to the model, and what the effects of these features are.

Linear models are very fast to train, and also fast to predict. They scale to very large datasets and work well with sparse data. 

Linear models often perform well when the number of features is large compared to the number of samples. They are also often used on very large datasets, simply because itâ€™s not feasible to train other models. However, in lower-dimensional spaces, other models might yield better generalization performance.
